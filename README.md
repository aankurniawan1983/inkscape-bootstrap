# Inkscape grid template for bootstrap

When I started work with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) I
missed a inkscape template to design my projects. So I create this template files
following the bootrstrap grid documentation.

I hope this files help you to learning and/or design your own project

## Using

Shortcut:

`Shift` + `|` (pipe)

In this new version, I added layers with samples and guides to help you design and learning
how bootstrap grid works!
